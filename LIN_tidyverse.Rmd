#pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(): converts between long and wide forms.
#unnest_longer(), unnest_wider(), hoist(): turns nested lists into tidy tibbles.
#nest(), unnest(): nesting creates a list-column of data frames; unnesting flattens it back out into regular columns.
#separate() and extract(): to pull a single character column into multiple columns.
#unite(): to combine multiple columns into a single character column.
#complete(): Make implicit missing values explicit.
#drop_na(): drops rows containing a missing value.
#fill(): replace missing values with next/previous value.
#replace_na(): replace NAs with specified values.

#mutate(): adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
#select(): picks variables based on their names.
#filter(): picks cases based on their values.
#summarise(): reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
#arrange(): changes the ordering of the rows.
#group_by(): perform any operation by group.
```

# Data structure
```{r stringr}
library(tidyverse)
str_length(Datafile$Abstract) #character count of each response

#str_c(): combine character vectors
#str_sub(): extract substring
#str_detect(x, pattern): tells you if thereâ€™s any match to the pattern.
#str_count(x, pattern) counts the number of patterns.
#str_subset(x, pattern) extracts the matching components.
#str_locate(x, pattern) gives the position of the match.
#str_extract(x, pattern) extracts the text of the match.
#str_match(x, pattern) extracts parts of the match defined by parentheses.
#str_replace(x, pattern, replacement) replaces the matches with new text.
#str_split(x, pattern) splits up a string into multiple pieces.
